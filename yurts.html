		<h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
			<h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
				<p>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off of the ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor and a dome that can be opened.
			<h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>
				<p>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. The luxury camping experience also includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.
			<h3>What should I bring?</h3>
				<p>Bring a sense of adventure and some time to relax! Most guests also pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with layers of clothing.
